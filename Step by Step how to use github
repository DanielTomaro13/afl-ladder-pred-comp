How to use GitHub

Here's a full step-by-step guide to help you **clone that GitHub repo**, create your own **branch**, make **local changes**, and **push it to your own GitHub** account.

---

### ✅ Step 1: **Fork the Repo to Your Own GitHub**
Since the repo is owned by `DanielTomaro13`, you should first fork it so that you can push changes to **your own GitHub**.

1. Go to: [https://github.com/DanielTomaro13/afl-ladder-pred-comp](https://github.com/DanielTomaro13/afl-ladder-pred-comp)
2. Click the **Fork** button (top-right of the page)
3. Choose your GitHub account as the destination

---

### ✅ Step 2: **Clone Your Fork Locally**
Once you've forked it, copy the **HTTPS URL** of your forked repo (it'll look like `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/afl-ladder-pred-comp.git`)

Then in your terminal:


# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/afl-ladder-pred-comp.git

# Navigate into the project folder
cd afl-ladder-pred-comp


---

### ✅ Step 3: **Set the Original Repo as "upstream" (optional but good practice)**

This helps you sync changes later from the original repo if needed.


git remote add upstream https://github.com/DanielTomaro13/afl-ladder-pred-comp.git


You can verify remotes with:


git remote -v


---

### ✅ Step 4: **Create Your Own Branch**
Now create a new branch for your local changes:


git checkout -b my-feature-branch

Replace `my-feature-branch` with a meaningful name. This can just be your first name



### ✅ Step 5: **Make Local Changes**
Do whatever edits, scripts, or changes you need in the repo files.

After you're done:


git add .
git commit -m "My changes to the AFL ladder prediction"

You can add whatever you like in the comment , usually a very very brief description of changes
---

### ✅ Step 6: **Push to Your GitHub Fork**
Push your branch up to **your fork**:


git push origin my-feature-branch


Now you'll see your branch in your GitHub repo.

---

### ✅ (Optional) Step 7: **Create a Pull Request**
If you ever want to merge your changes back into the original repo (`DanielTomaro13/afl-ladder-pred-comp`):

1. Go to your GitHub repo
2. You’ll see a prompt to create a **Pull Request**
3. Open it and write a description of what you've changed
